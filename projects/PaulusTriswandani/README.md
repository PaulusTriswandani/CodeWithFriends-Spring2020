# Private Blog or should I say Public Blog?

## Background
After becoming a NEET (Not in Employment, Education, and Training) for around 10 years, I got bored. Very very bored. And then one of the youtuber I follow which is [Mayuko san](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEDkO7wshcDZ7UZo17rPkzQ) (which I follow from the affiliate of someone's youtube channel from some group in the internet) announced an event called [Code with Friends 2020](https://cwf.hellomayuko.com). I who frustrated from one ctf (Capture the Flag) event to another think, maybe it's time for a change and make something instead of trying to break it. Besides, breaking the internet is definitely not a thing, only Ralph did that. So here I am, rumbling about how hard life is and still rumbling, and decide to make a blog.

## My Actual Blog
It is ongoing or under construction, but if you want to see my futile effort into making something for a change can visit [this link](https://PaulusTriswandani.github.io). It's just a blog, but I want to investigate the inner working how static site generator do its thing. Thank you for the opportunity to join an event like this. I wish I didn't get more frustrated by it.

## Post Script
Oh yeah, almost forgot. I use my native language which is Indonesian language in my blog. But it's about coding, what could possibly go wrong even if you don't understand the language. Even the source of the knowledge is in English.
